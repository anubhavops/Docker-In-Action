# Chapter 01

> Docker isn’t a programming language, and it isn’t a framework for building software. Docker is a tool that helps solve common problems such as installing, removing, upgrading, distributing, trusting, and running software. It’s open source Linux software, which means that anyone can contribute to it and that it has benefited from a variety of perspectives. It’s common for companies to sponsor the development of open source projects. In this case, Docker Inc. is the primary sponsor. You can find out more about Docker Inc. at https://docker.com/company/.

> Docker is an open source project for building, shipping, and running programs. It is a command-line program, a background process, and a set of remote services that take a logistical approach to solving common software problems and simplifying your experience installing, running, publishing, and removing software. It accomplishes this by using an operating system technology called containers.

```
docker run dockerinaction/hello_world
```
